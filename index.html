          Mohammad Iqbal, a descendant of a Kashmiri Brahmin family
          that had embraced Islam in the seventeenth century, was born and
          settled in Sialkot. After a traditional education in Arabic, Persian,
          and Urdu, he was exposed to a liberal education that defined the
          contours of his thought and his poetry during the entire period of his
          life. Beginning his educational career at the Scottish Mission School,
          he went on to acquire his M. A. in Philosophy, before joining Trinity
          College, and later earning the degree of Bar-at-Law. He furthered his
          education by getting the degree of doctorate from Germany on The
          Development of Metaphysics in Persia. He worked in different
          capacities at different points of time; he taught philosophy,
          practised law, got involved in politics, and also attended the second
          Round Table Conference. Even while he favoured the idea of the
          creation of Pakistan and is venerated there as the national poet, he
          wrote the famous patriotic song that celebrates the greatness of
          India. King George V decorated him with knighthood and he was called
          Sir Mohammad Iqbal thereafter.

          Iqbal wrote both in Persian and Urdu, and is often regarded as the
          poet-philosopher of the East who addressed the Muslim ummah, believed
          in the philosophy of wahdatul wujood, and propounded the philosohy of
          khudi, or selfhood, which called for self-realisation and the
          discovery of the hidden talent with love and perseverance. Beyond that
          lay the stages of complete submission and forgetfulness which, he
          thought, was the ultimate stage of khudi. Iqbal dreamt of the
          ‘complete man’ and also entered into a metaphoric dialogue with the
          divine. His poetry emerged as a remarkable site where message and art
          coalesced, as he re-configured major poetic devices like metaphor,
          myth, and symbol to re-visit history, philosophy and the Islamic faith
          to develop his individual vision. He has left behind his collections
          of poems, Asraar-e Khudi, Rumooz-e Bekhudi, Baang-e Daraa, Baal-e
          Jibreel, Payaam-e Mashriq, Zaboor-e ‘Ajm, Javed Naama, Zarb-e Kaleem,
          and Armaghaan-e Hijaz, apart from his lectures collected in English as
          The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, and other works on
          the Eastern worldview.
